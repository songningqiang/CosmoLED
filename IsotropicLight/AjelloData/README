This folder contains data from x-ray and gamma ray telescopes compiled and provided by Marco Ajello. This compilation of data was originally presented in the paper:
M. Ajello et al., “Cosmic X-ray background and Earth albedo Spectra with Swift/BAT,” Astrophys. J. 689, 666 (2008), arXiv:0808.3377 [astro-ph].

To use additional or different data for the isotropic light constraints, edit the maxIntensity() function in isotropicLight.py to ensure the new data is being read.

The included data files are in the xspec format where the columns are:
- Energy (keV)
- Lower Energy Error (keV)
- Upper Energy Error (keV)
- Flux (keV / cm^2 / s / sr)
- Lower Flux Error (keV / cm^2 / s / sr)
- Upper Flux Error (keV / cm^2 / s / sr)
