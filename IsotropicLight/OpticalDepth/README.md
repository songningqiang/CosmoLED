The code in this folder was written by Katherine Mack and Daniel Wesley. Explanations of the optical depth calculation can be found in their paper: [arxiv:0805.1531](https://arxiv.org/abs/0805.1531). Only small modifcations were made to od.c and odNoComptonTau.c for the purpose of integrating with the Isotropic Light python code.

To compile the code in in this folder, return to the parent directory and run
