n=0 from BlackHawk

For scalars, fermions, gauge bosons and n=0 gravitons:

1) The first column is omega*r_h, and the second column is sigma/(pi*r_h^2)

2) The table can be extrapolated with a constant value corresponding to the last number in the second column

For n>0 gravitons:

1) The first column is omega*r_h, and the second column is sum_l N_l |A_l|^2 / (omega*r_h)^(n+2)

2) The table can be extrapolated with a constant value corresponding to the last number in the second column
