   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to DarkAges's documentation!
====================================

This is the documentation of the :code:`DarkAges`-module for Python_ to provide
tools for the calculation of the *effective efficiency function*
:math:`f(z)` used to quantify the impact of non-standard energy injection
on cosmology.

To do so the package fulfills the following two objectives:

#. Providing useful methods and classes in the scope of such calculation, to be 
   easily imported into other instances of Python_.
#. Providing a program which automatically performs a session of calculating
   :math:`f(z)` given a certain set of input parameters
